Supervised Learning : 
	Regression : predict a number from infintly many possible numbers
	Classfication : predict categories don t have to be numbers small 			possible 
			
Unsupervised Learning : Find something interesting in unlabled data 
	Clustering aloghrithm : takes a data without labels and tries 		automatically group them into clusters 
	Anomaly Detection : Find unsual data points 
	Dimensionality reduction : Compress data using fewer numbers
